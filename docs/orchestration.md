### Smart Model Routing
The orchestration engine automatically selects the most appropriate model for each task:
- Code-related tasks are routed to code-specialized models (e.g., codellama)
- General conversation tasks use general-purpose models
- Embedding tasks use appropriate embedding models

### Workflow Dependencies
Multi-step workflows support dependency management through placeholder replacement:
- Use `{{step1}}`, `{{step2}}`, etc. to reference previous step outputs
- Use `{{stepname}}` to reference steps by name
- Automatic context passing between workflow steps

### Performance Tracking
All task executions include comprehensive metrics:
- Execution duration
- Token usage (when available)
- Model selection and routing decisions
- Success/failure status with error details

### Parallel and Sequential Execution
- **Sequential**: Tasks execute one after another, allowing dependency chains
- **Parallel**: Tasks execute simultaneously for maximum throughput
- Configurable per request based on requirements

## Configuration

### Agent Configuration
Agents support flexible configuration options:
```json
{
  "max_concurrent_tasks": 3,
  "default_model": "llama3.2",
  "timeout_seconds": 300,
  "routing_preferences": {
    "code": "codellama",
